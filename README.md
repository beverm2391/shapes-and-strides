# Shapes and Strides

This is a sub-project of my n-dim array library [teenyarray](https://github.com/beverm2391/teenyarray) that focuses on storing n-dimensional arrays (or Tensors) in linear, contigious memory.

Some of the refereces I'm using include
- Travis Oliphant's *[Guide to Numpy](https://web.mit.edu/dvp/Public/numpybook.pdf)*
- Alex (ajcr)'s series or blog posts, [An Illustraetd Guide To Shapes and Strides](https://ajcr.net/stride-guide-part-1/)

The goal is to build out an n-dim array class in Python and then port it over to Cpp to be integrated into teenyarray.

## TODO
- [ ] write tests (compare against numpy) for ndarray class
- [ ] resume on page 29 of *guide to numpy*
- [ ] finish and test the python implement
- [ ] write a cpp implementation in this repo
- [ ] write all the cpp tests
- [ ] bind to python
- [ ] implement in the teenyarray lib
- [ ] write a blog post??
